           <p class='question-green'><b>Q: When should we bring in an outside facilitator?</b></p>
           <p>There are many instances an outside facilitator is crucial. Some examples are:</p>
           <ul>
             <li>Meeting outcomes are critical to reaching goals</li>
             <li>High-stakes decisions and planning to be accomplished</li>
             <li>Group leader wants to participate fully without worrying about running the meeting</li>
             <li>Long-range goals are being set</li>
             <li>Important changes and strategies are necessary</li>

          <p class='question-blue'><b>Q: What is <i>Everything DiSC<sup>&reg;</sup></i> and how can it help my business?</b></p>
          <p><i>Everything DiSC<sup>&reg;</sup></i> is a trademarked assessment tool that helps individuals understand their behavioral preferences in the context of their work. It takes about 15 minutes to answer a series of word choices about how you see yourself in your work role, and then provides an in-depth report about your style and how you relate to different styles of others.</p>
          <p>An individual professional can learn how to be a more effective communicator and increase influence by adapting to the styles of others.</p>
          <p>Whole teams and groups of employees benefit greatly by having a common language to discuss their differences and similarities; tolerance and respect for those differences is greatly improved by teams who use <i>Everything DiSC<sup>&reg;</sup></i> on an ongoing basis as part of their team-building efforts.</p>
          <p>Managers use their knowledge of <i>Everything DiSC<sup>&reg;</sup></i> to provide better feedback, run more effective meetings and to streamline their team efforts by adding strengths and styles that might be under-represented.</p><br>
          <p class='question-green'><b>Q: How do I know which version of <i>Everything DiSC<sup>&reg;</sup></i> to use for my business?</b></p>
          <p>We help you define what you want your organization to achieve by determining goals as well as help you understand the program choices available that best suit your needs.</p>
          <p><i>Everything DiSC<sup>&reg;</sup></i> Workplace can be used with any level of employee and with groups from all levels of your organization in order to understand why people each see things so differently and how those differences are necessary for success. </p>
          <p><i>Everything DiSC<sup>&reg;</sup></i> Management helps managers and supervisors increase their influence and communication with individual employees.</p>
          <p><i>Everything DiSC<sup>&reg;</sup></i> Work of Leaders helps leaders, teams of leaders, and those new to leadership positions understand both their own leadership style and their strengths and challenges in the process of leadership.</p> 
          <p><i>Everything DiSC<sup>&reg;</sup></i> Sales is a powerful tool for understanding your individual selling style and the style of key customers, so that you can adapt your communication to meet the customer's needs.</p><br>
          <p class='question-blue'><b>Q: Will our employees be concerned about having their personal DiSC style be used against them or limit their job opportunities?</b></p>
          <p>We promise confidentiality to each individual who takes any assessment through our firm. We do not share an individual's report even with an employer who might have paid for it and we encourage employers and employees to willingly share their <i>Everything DiSC<sup>&reg;</sup></i> Style information with each other.</p><br>
          <p class='question-green'><b>Q: Wouldn't my style change as I change jobs or become more experienced in my profession?</b></p>
          <p>Research shows that our personal styles stay pretty static over time, but we have seen people whose <i>Everything DiSC<sup>&reg;</sup></i> report has changed. Usually this is due to major changes in job responsibilities and professional growth. In some cases, the testing methods have improved in accuracy since the first report was completed.</p><br>
          <p class='question-blue'><b>Q: Are some styles better for certain professions or jobs?</b></p>
          <p>One of the research findings that first captured our interest in using <i>Everything DiSC<sup>&reg;</sup></i> as a tool with our clients was that no particular style would make a person more or less successful in any chosen endeavor, but understanding their natural style preferences and those of other people within the organization can make a enormous difference in anyone’s ability to be successful.</p><br>
          <p class='question-green'><b>Q: What if I took an Everything DiSC profile or assessment and can't find it in the future?</b></p>
          <p>We keep every report issued through our system and can resend it electronically at any time. We recommend that each person save a copy to their hard drive, as it will have many valuable applications in the future.</p>
